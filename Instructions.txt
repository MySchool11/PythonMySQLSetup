So the first thing you need is to have all the pre-requisites installed

1) MySQL --> https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

You will need to register an account with Oracle if you do not have one already. When you install the software be sure to include the
Worbench and Python connector as well as MySQL - other additions are up to you but we need those for the course

You can at this point create the necessary user and database we will be using (see section 3) or just do it at step 3

2) PyCharm --> https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows

Download the Community version as this is free. Install it, doh.

3) You will need to add the test database and test user we will make use of in the lessons (if you have not done so at step 1)

So, open the MySQL shell, you should see:

mysql-js>

Here, the first thing to do is to add the psudo-user we will need to do is connect to the localhopst database, like so

mysql-js> \connect root@localhost

Then enter your root password at the prompt

Now we create the new user:

mysql-js> \sql
mysql-sql> CREATE USER 'test_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY ' password';
mysql-sql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'test_user'@'localhost';
mysql-sql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


That's it - we now have a user named test_user with the password password on the localhost instance of MySQL. Next we can create the test 
database (ensure your command prompt still shows mysql-sql>)

mysql-sql> CREATE DATABASE test_db;

If this works, you have done it. You may get an error saying "database exists", well that one is obvious (it already exists). You may get
one saying "Access denies for user 'user details'" this means you need to log in as the root or other user with cretaion privileges (you
should not suffer this issue if you have followed along with this tutorial)

So - you are now ready, you should have the MySQL database installed, the Python connector installed, PyCharm installed and the new user
and database created.
